I decided to use google sheets and google charts to implement my data visualization projects for the course. After taking an online open class on D3 and learning about the myraid of data viz tools available, I chose google charts becasue it allows for enough customization of the chart elements, and google sheets is sufficient for the kind of data cleaning and analysis that I needed.
I find visual presentation very important, so being able to customize my chart on google's platform was very important.

I used global survey data from Pew Research Center and GDP data from World Bank. I looked through their survey lists and read their blogs the uncovered important global trends, and decided on the theme of my projects. 

I used a template from https://app.cssmenumaker.com/?theme_id=20 to implement my site, and published it on github. Looking back, I could have used a responsive bootstrap library. I hope to modify the site to make it mobile friendly in the future, as I publish more data viz work on the site. 

I mainly used W3 School's html and css manual when I laied out the graphics and texts and found it very straightforward.
