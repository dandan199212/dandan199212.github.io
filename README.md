My project is a website with several data visualizations that I published on github:https://dandan199212.github.io/

You can navigate through the pages very easily. I can't think of anything that might be unclear for implementation at this point...

You can also run a local server to host the site, with the python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000 command line in the terminal window, and use the address http://localhost:8000/ to navigate to the site folder.
